# JavaScript book, Ch. 10, “Error Handling & Debugging”
## The Stack
> The JavaScript interpreter processes one line of code at a time. When a statement needs data from another function, it stacks (or piles) the new function on top of the currnet task.

## Execution Context & Hoisting
Each time a script enters a new execution context, there are two phases of activity:

1. Prepare
   - The new scope is created
   - Variables, functions, and arguments are created
   - The value of the "this" keyword is determined
2. Execute
   - Now it can assign values to variables
   - Reference functions and run their code
   - Execute statements

## Error Objects
When an Error object is created, it will contain the following properties:

   - **name** - type of execution
   - **message** - description
   - **fileNumber** - name of the JavaScript file
   - **lineNumber** - line number of error
   
There are seven types of built-in error objects in JavaScript:

   - **Error** - Generic error - the other errors are all based upon this error
   - **SyntaxError** - Syntax has not been followed
   - **ReferenceError** - Tried to reference a variable that is not declared/within scope
   - **TypeError** - An unexpected data type that cannot be coerced
   - **RangeError** - Numbers not in acceptable range
   - **URIError** - encodeURI(), decodeURI(), and similar methods used incorrectly
   - **EvalError** - eval() function used incorrectly

## A Debuggin Workflow
### Where is the problem?
1. Look at the error message.
2. Check how far the script is running.
3. Use breakpoints where things are going wrong.

###What exactly is the problem?
1. When you have set breakpoints, you can see if the variables around them have the values you would expect them to. If not, look earlier in the script.
2. Break down / break out parts of the code to test - Write values of variables to the console. - Call functions from the console to check if they are returning what you would expect them to. - Check if objects exist and have the methods/properties that you think they do.
3. Check the number of parameters for a function, or the number of items in an array.
