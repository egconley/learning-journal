# The Past, Present, & Future of Local Storage for Web Applications
[article link](http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html)

## The Dream
- a lot of storage space
- on the client
- that persists beyond a page refresh
- and isn't transmitted to the server

> Before HTML5, all attempts to achieve this were ultimately unsatisfactory in different ways.

(native applications already had access to local storage)

## A Brief History of Local Storage Hacks Before HTML5
- In the beginning, there was only Internet Explorer.
  - Microsoft invented DHTML Behaviors during the First Great Browser Wars, including a behavior called userData.
     - allowed web pages to store up to 64 KB of dcata per domain
- In 2002, Adobe introduced "Flash cookies" for Flash 6
  - allows Flash objects to store up to 100 KB of data per domain
  - Brad Neuberg and the Falsh-to-JavaScript bridge (AMASS)
- In 2007, Google launced Gears, 
  - provided an API to an embedded SQL database based on SQLite
- In the meantime, Brad Neueberg and others continued to hack away on dojox.storage to provide a unified interface to all these different plugins and APIs

> all of these solutions are either specific to a single browser, or reliant on a third-party plugin.

## Introducing HTML5 Storage
HTML5 Storage = Web Storage = Local Storage = DOM Storage

**What it is** - a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser, persists after you navigate away from teh web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, etc.

> From your JavaScript code, you'll access HTML5 Storage through the `localStorage` object on the global `window` object.

## Beyond Named Key-Value Pairs: Competing Visions
1. SQL
2. the Indexed Database API (formerly WebSimpleDB, now IndexedDM)
