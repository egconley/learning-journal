# Docs for the HTML <canvas> Element & Chart.js

## The Canvas API

### Basic Usage
> The <canvas> element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more **rendering contexts**, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown. 

`<canvas>` element: key attributes = height and width

### Drawing Shapes with Canvas
> The origin of this grid is positioned in the **top left corner** at coordinate (0,0).

### Drawing Rectangles
A filled rectangle:
```
fillRect(x, y, width, height)
```
A rectangular outline:
```
strokeRect(x, y, width, height)
```
Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.
```
clearRect(x, y, width, height)
```

### Drawing Paths
1. First, you create the path.
    - `beginPath()`
2. Then you use [drawing commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D#Paths) to draw into the path.
   - `closePath()`
3. Once the path has been created, you can stroke or fill the path to render it.
   - `stroke()`
   - `fill()`
