### What is a text editor?
> ...a piece of software that...allows you to write and manage text...to build a web site.

### Key features to look for:
1. code completion
    - [Emmet](https://web.archive.org/web/20190112212256/https://emmet.io/) 
      * a shorthand language that helps you speed up your coding
      * can be added as an extension if not already built in
2. syntax highlighting
    - such that attributes, elements, and copy are all different colors
3. variety of themes
    - allow you to change the background color of your editor
4. good selection of extensions
    - plugins for your text editor
   
   
*On Macs, the text editor that comes with the computer is called "Text Edit."  

### Tips when using the text editor that comes with your computor.
- Make sure that you're coding in plain text.  
- First, make a folder that stores your *entire website*, and as you create new documents, save these in a filing system that makes sense.
- When you save a file, make sure you add the appropriate extension at the end of the file name.

### Third-Party Options
- NotePad++
- TextWrangler/BB Edit
- Visual Studio Code
- Atom
- Brackets
- Sublime Text

### Text Editors vs. Integrated Development Environments (IDE's)
