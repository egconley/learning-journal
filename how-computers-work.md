### What makes a computer a computer?** *Computers...*
1. Take input
2. Store information
3. Process that information
4. Output the results

### Binary & Data
> Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer.

*One wire can be either **on**-if there's electricity running through-or **off**.* 
This represents the smallest piece of information that a computer can store, called a **bit**.

**The binary number system** translates the 0's and 1's from bits into larger numbers, text, images, and sounds.

### Circuits
> Circuits modify and process information that's represented in 1's and 0's.

*A simple circuit takes an electric signal and **flips** it.*

*More complicated circuits take **multiple signals & combine them** to give different results.*

### CPU, Memory, Input, & Output
1. **Input devices** convert physical input to binary information.
2. **Memory** stores this information.
3. The **CPU** *(Central Processing Unit)* calculates information using instructions stored in memory.
4. **Output devices** convert information to physical output.

### Software and Hardware
> The CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer.  It receives simple commands that tell it which circuit to use.

*Programming languages allow us to give the CPU commands that look similar to English.  These commands are then converted into **hundreds or thousands** of simplier binardy commands that the CPU can process.*

**The operating system** is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.
> The operating system is a program with special abilities that let it control other software on the computer.  

*When you think your computer is running many programs at once, in reality, it's the operating system that's quickly switching between programs, sharing the CPU for fractions of a second.*
