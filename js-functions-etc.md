## Read 07: Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery

### How JavaScript makes web pages more interactive
1. Access content
    - select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page
2. Modify content
    - add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them
3. Program rules
    - specify a set of steps for the browser to follow, which allows it to access or change the content of a page
4. React to events
    - specify that a script should run when a specific event has occured
  
### Scripts

**script** - *a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.*
    - *to write a script: first state your goal and then list the task that need to be completed in order to achieve it.*
        1. Define the goal.
        2. Design the script.
           - First, map out the tasks in a flowchart.
           - Second, list the steps required to complete each task.
        3. Code each step.
 
### Expressions

> An **expression** evaluates into...a single value.

#### Two Types of Expressions
1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value

#### Operators
- **Assignment operators** assign a value to a variable
- **Arithmetic operators** perform basic math
  - addition +
  - subtraction -
  - division /
  - multiplication *
  - increment ++ ex. i = 10; i++; *returns 11*
  - decrement -- ex. i = 10; i--; *returns 9*
  - modulus % *returns the remainder of two values*
- **String operators** combine two strings
- **Comparison operators** compare two values and return *true* or *false*
- **Logical operators** combine expressions and return *true* or *false*

#### Functions

##### Vocab
- When you ask a function to perform a task, it is known as **calling** the function.
- Pieces of information passed to a function are known as **parameters**.
- When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is known as a **return value**.

##### Syntax
    function sayHello() {
      document.write('Hello!');
    }
