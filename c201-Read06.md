### Object Literals
> Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world.  In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

*In an object: variables become known as **properties** and functions become known as **methods**.*

#### Creating an Object: Literal Notation
     1 var hotel = {
     2   name: 'Quay',
     3   rooms: 40,
     4   booked: 25,
     5   checkAvailability: function() {
     6     return this.room - this.booked;
     7   }
     8 }
     
where *hotel* is an **object**, *var, name, rooms, booked,* and *checkAvailability* are **keys**, and *everthing else* is a **value**

You can access properties and methods of an object using dot notation.  

`var hotelName = hotel.name;`

`var roomsFree = hotel.checkAvailability();`

You can also access the properties of an object using bracket syntax.

`var hotelName = hotel['name'];`
