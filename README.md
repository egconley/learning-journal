Hello!  My name is Ellen.  I'm so excited to be taking this plunge into software development with Code Fellows.  Check out the link to my GitHub portfolio page [here](https://egconley.github.io/learning-journal/).

#### Growth Mindset
**Growth mindset** is about *trusting your ability to learn new things*.  People with a growth mindset ***embrace challenge*** and **_expect failure_ as a _productive part_ of the learning process**.  

#### Self-Reminders to Maintain a Growth Mindset
- _~~Avoid~~_ Embrace challenge!
- _~~Loose focus~~_ Persist in the face of obstacles!
- Put in effort, *no pain, no gain*.
- _~~Ignore~~_ Learn from criticism.
- Look to the success of others as a _~~threat~~_ source of inspiration.
